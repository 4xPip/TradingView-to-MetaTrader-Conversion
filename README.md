# TradingView to MetaTrader Conversion
Many traders and developers find themselves needing to convert indicators or scripts from TradingView to MetaTrader for greater flexibility. TradingView and MetaTrader are two of the most commonly used platforms for automated trading / day trading. TradingView is popular for its advanced charting tools and ease of use, allowing traders to create custom scripts with Pine Script. Meanwhile, MetaTrader (MT4 and MT5) is well-known for supporting automated trading through Expert Advisors (EAs), which are built with MQL4 or MQL5.

# Difference Between TradingView Scripts and MetaTrader?
The main differences between Pine Script and MetaQuotes Language (MQL) are in their language structure, where they run, automation abilities, and community focus. Pine Script, used by TradingView, is a simple language made for technical analysis and chart indicators. It's cloud-based, so you can access your scripts from anywhere, but you need third-party tools for automated trading. On the other hand, MetaTrader's MQL4/MQL5 are more complex and similar to C++, made for fully automated trading. They run on your computer or a VPS, giving you full control over trades. MetaTrader leans towards professional development with paid tools, while TradingView has a community where people freely share scripts and strategies.
